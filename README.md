# Hospital-Patients-Records-using-SQL
This project provides actionable insights to improve hospital operations and enhance patient care through better data-driven decision-making.



**Overview**

This project involves analyzing hospital patient records using SQL to extract actionable insights and streamline hospital operations. The project includes creating a database, data cleaning, and performing detailed data exploration to understand patient demographics, billing patterns, and treatment outcomes.


**Project Objectives**

    ---Efficiently manage and analyze hospital patient data.
    ---Perform data cleaning to ensure accurate and reliable insights.
    ---Explore patient demographics, billing patterns, and treatment trends.
    ---Generate actionable insights to improve hospital operations and patient care.


**Project Steps**

**Step 1:Database Creation**

    ---Created a database named hospital_records.
    ---Designed and implemented tables to store patient data.
    ---Defined appropriate data types and constraints for each column.
    
**Step 2: Data Insertion**

    ---Inserted sample data into the database tables.
    ---Ensured data completeness and consistency.
    
**Step 3: Data Cleaning**

    ---Checked for null values in the dataset.
    ---Listed and handled rows with null values.
    ---Identified and removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
    
**Step 4: Data Exploration and Analysis**

  --Performed the following queries to gain insights:

    ---Number of Patients by Gender
    ---Average Bill Amount by Medical Condition
    ---Most Frequent Medical Condition
    ---Total Revenue Generated by the Hospital
    ---Patients Admitted in a Specific Time Period
    ---Bill Amount Distribution
    ---Revenue by Gender
    ---Most Common Treatments
    ---Patients with a Specific Medical Condition
    ---Patients Whose Bills Are Above Average
    ---Patients Treated by Specific Doctors or Notes
    ---Correlation Between Gender and Medical Condition
    ---Patients Admitted but Never Discharged
    ---Patients Whose Treatment Duration Exceeds 10 Days

**Tools and Technologies Used**

    ---SQL: For database creation, data cleaning, and analysis.
    ---MySQL Workbench: For writing and executing SQL queries.
    ---Microsoft Excel (Optional): For initial dataset inspection and preparation.

**Key Insights**

    ---Identified the most frequent medical conditions and the most common treatments.
    ---Determined average bill amounts based on medical conditions and patient demographics.
    ---Uncovered correlations between gender and medical conditions.
    ---Highlighted operational inefficiencies (e.g., patients admitted but never discharged).
    ---Gained insights into revenue patterns by gender and treatment types.


**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze hospital patient records efficiently. The insights provide a foundation for improving hospital operations and enhancing patient care.
